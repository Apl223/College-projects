# Summary

Projects and assignments that I did at school with Jupyter Notebook. Python/SQL.
Libraries: BeatifulSoup, sqlite, Flask, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib. 

### [Real estate prices](https://github.com/Apl223/College_and-Machine-Learning-projects/tree/main/RealEstatePrices)
Populating prediction results into a SQLite3 database then querying and displaying their results with Flask.

This program requires the user to input the url or path to the csv file that will be parsed. It then targets sale prices and uses other columns in the set as features to predict housing prices. It splits training and validation data to fit the models that are going to be used to take the mean absolute error in three different methods: Decision tree, Decision tree with a maximum limit of 100 and Random Forest.

### [Analyzing stocks](https://github.com/Apl223/College_and-Machine-Learning-projects/tree/main/AnalyzingStocks-main)
Web scraping stock sites with BeautifulSoup, creating and inserting the data into a SQLite3 database, and using Flask to display it.

### [Poisonous mushroom features](https://github.com/Apl223/College-projects/blob/main/MushroomClassification/mushroom.ipynb)
Predicting which features of a mushroom correlate to being poisonous. Used pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib libraries. 

### [Software Application Programming II](https://github.com/Apl223/College_and-Machine-Learning-projects/tree/main/Software-Application-Programming-II-IS-211-main)
Learning more OOP concepts with lists and dictionaries.
This where we began to populate databases and use SQL queries in our scripts a long with Flask.

### [Data-Acquisition and Management IS 362](https://github.com/Apl223/College_and-Machine-Learning-projects/tree/main/Data-Acquisition-and-Management-IS-362-main)
Taking what we learned in Software Application Programming
and applying it to datasets for analysis. We looked at weather and
airline performance sets.
